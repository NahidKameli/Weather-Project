## About the Project
Weather Project is a React-based web application designed to help users check current weather conditions and forecasts for any location. By leveraging a weather API, it provides real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, all presented in a clean and responsive UI.

### Why This Project?
- Showcases modern React development with API integration.
- Provides a practical tool for checking weather updates.
- Open-source and ready for contributions to enhance functionality.

## Features
- üåç Search weather by city or location.
- üå°Ô∏è Real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- üìÖ Short-term weather forecasts (if implemented).
- üì± Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
- üñºÔ∏è Clean and intuitive UI for a seamless user experience.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: ^18.x.x for building the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: Core language for logic and API calls.
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling the application.
- **External API**: Weather data fetched from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) or similar.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting.
- **Vite** (optional): If used for fast development and bundling.

## API Integration
This project uses a weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/)) to fetch real-time weather data, including:
- Current temperature and weather conditions.
- Humidity, wind speed, and pressure.
- Short-term forecasts (if implemented).

To use the API:
1. Sign up for an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) or your chosen provider.
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:
   ```env
<<<<<<< HEAD
   VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
=======
   VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
>>>>>>> 66cc3fed7a9048d501dd17af0c3ae62d28db95c2
